**General comments regarding the AZ-103 course**

* PowerShell scripts in all labs use the current version of Azure PowerShell Az module.

* Although not required, it is a good idea to deprovision any existing resources when you have completed each lab. This will help mitigate the risk of exceeding the default vCPU quota limits and minimize usage charges.
